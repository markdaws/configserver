1. Install node from: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Open a terminal, change to the configserver directory.
3. Run the server, pointing to the config file directory:
```bash
npm start /Users/bob/code/myapp
```

At this point a webserver will start and the config directory will be visible on the port shown in the terminal output.
